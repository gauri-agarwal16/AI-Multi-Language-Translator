## 🌐 AI Powered Multi-Language Translator

This project is a **Google Colab-based application** that enables users to translate text across multiple languages using `MarianMT` models from **Hugging Face** Transformers. It provides an intuitive, easy-to-use notebook interface where users can input text, choose source and target languages, and receive high-quality translations in real-time.

## 🔍 How It Works

- The notebook loads a pretrained MarianMTModel and Tokenizer based on the chosen source and target languages.

- It uses the transformers library to perform translation tasks with just a few lines of code.

- The model is executed directly in the Colab environment — no need for heavy installations or configurations.
